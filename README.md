This challenge originated from Frontend Mentor. I wanted to challenge myself to use Reactjs to make a landing page exactly like their final product.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (mobile or desktop)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
